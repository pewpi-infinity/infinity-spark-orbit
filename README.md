Machine #1 built by Kris Watson on Infinity Spark Node for Infinity Systems. Brain stem / website builder search and deploy chain reaction domino effect of token→research→website→advertising→value→ASSETS 

Every website has a token, and every website is a machine with a purpose that has generated income to both the owner of license (token holder) and the infinity ecosystem. quantinstantly proposed with microcontroller environment pulling live data to extract real assets to attach to the back end as token exchange routes. Instant build and trade token economy. 

Building increases asset exchange and value of token beyond the common $1 infinity token value for basic use in economic situations. it's like taking a dollar bill and looking up the serial number patterns to see if it's got high value to it and to raise its value there are things you do like preserve protect and grade and collect in collections increasing values.
